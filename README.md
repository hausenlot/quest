# First Rails 7 project.
# This is just a To-Do. If its just a simple CRUD this already finished within 2 days.
# Found out that theres a tech called turbo (idk what is this, its not even a gem.)
# Learned the barebones of turbo. Very good but so confusing once you gotten to nesting the turbo frames.

# As of first commit front end is bare bones going to take care the back end first
# Trying to host this to Render
