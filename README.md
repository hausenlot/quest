# First Rails 7 project that I built alone.
# This project is preferrebly good in desktop 16:9 aspect ratio. 
# I tried making it scale on different aspect ratio and it worked but not so good you can just check it out for yourself and judge it.
# It took 4 weeks, Really slow I know. I hate how that procastinating took a lot more times than me actually coding this. Meaning I was stucked for really long time and cant find answers.
# I copied this template https://uizard.io/templates/website-templates/to-do-website/ the only thing I copied is how it looks, Every code that on this project is mine alone.
# This project is for myself only, If there's a chance someone want to us this for something i dont know please dont get me involve hahahaha.
# I learned a lot. I now know I sucked at programming, Im a noob basically even coding for 2 years.
# I used things that I dont know like PostgreSQL, Tailwind, turbo and Stimulus controllers and I really learned a lot.
